Attached is a list of your slurm jobs that completed within the last 24 hours
on the Orion cluster that used more than 5 CPU minutes. The list is limited to
the 100 oldest jobs.

Please note how much CPU time you requested versus what you actually used,
and how much memory (MaxRRS) you used.

PLEASE adjust your slurm script so you don't waste CPU nor memory:
#SBATCH --ntasks=2 # My app will use two CPUs.
#SBATCH --mem=5G   # My app will use max 5GB of memory. Warning: Job will be
                   # killed if it uses more than 5GB!

PS: Currently, using --mem is optional. However, we consider making this
mandatory.

Have a nice, productive and efficient day!

Cheers,
The Orion cluster administrators, cigene-support@rt.nmbu.no
